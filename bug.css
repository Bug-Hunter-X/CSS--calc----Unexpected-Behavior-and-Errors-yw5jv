The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely cause issues because '10' lacks a unit.  Another issue arises when nesting `calc()` expressions without proper parenthesis. For instance, `margin: calc(calc(10px + 5px) * 2);` might not compute correctly without enough parenthesis: `margin: calc((calc(10px + 5px) ) * 2);`
